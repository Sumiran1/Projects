# Olympic data - context driven chatbot

In less than 12 hours created a context driven chatbot to help better answer 2016 Olympics snack venue information as a POC for a hackathon (placed as a runner up). Leveraged openAI APIs, as well as flask, HTML, and CSS. 

Proved that given speicific information, could enhance viewer experience for the 2028 LA olympics using the 2016 data as a benchmark.

Planning to integrate the OpenAI whisper API, AWS translate, and AWS Polly to create a multilingual speech <-> text chatbot
