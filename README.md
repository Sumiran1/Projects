# Projects
Hello, my name is Sumiran Singh Thakur, and I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Accenture. In my time there, I have grown as a data scientist and taken an avid interest/effort in pushing the models I build into production. In so far, I have gained a lot of experience in MLOps and MLE work in GCP and AWS, and being within consulting, have also learned to communicate the value of robust model development and management to stakeholders as such.

I graduated from MIT in 2021 with a Masters in Data Science, and from UC Berkeley in 2020, where I majored in Bioengineering, and have had a lot of coursework in machine learning, deep learning and data science as a whole.I have an avid interest in the field of computational medicine, and integrating my BioEngineering backround with the aspects of data science in order to better prepare me for my future. 

If you navigate to my LinkedIn: you can read through some of the research I have published, with highlights surrounding deep learning based arrhythmia detection, and AI induced fairness in medical models.

I am a data scientist/machine learning engineer and have therefore undertaken projects (some with the aid of friends) to help hone my data science skills, while also integrating my passions of powerlifting and NBA basketball. Please feel free to contact me at sumi123@berkeley.edu/ sumi123@mit.edu for any questions, and happy coding :)
