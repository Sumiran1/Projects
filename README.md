# Projects
Hello, my name is Sumiran Singh Thakur, and I am senior at UC Berkeley majoring in BioEngineering and minoring in EECS.
I have an avid interest in the field of computational medicine, and integrating my BioEngineering backround with the 
aspects of data science in order to better prepare me for my future. I am an aspiring data scientist and have therefore
undertaken projects (some with the aid of friends) to help hone my data science skills, while also integrating my passions
of powerlifting and NBA basketball. Please feel free to contact me at sumi123@berkeley.edu for any questions, and happy coding :)
