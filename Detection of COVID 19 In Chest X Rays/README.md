This was a project I chose to undertake as it was offered to us as an optional project for the optimization course, EECS 127, 
at UC Berkeley. I used a chest x-ray dataset readily available from kaggle, and the ipynb as well as the paper are very clear in 
the methodologies used. This was a very useful project to undertake, and it is very relevant to my current research as well.
